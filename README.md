# The-Thick-Of-It
A Minecraft mod made with a friend whose name also starts with a J, hence the JJCraft placeholder. Just for fun!

Having dived into Python and GDScript for my flagship project, Taking London, I realised I'd left a whole in my Java knowledge. What better excuse is there to start
providing additional unofficial content (known as a "mod", in the gaming community) for one of mine, and indeed the world's, best loved games - Minecraft!

As I'm sure we've all noticed, the state of politics in the modern world is a sorry state. The inspiration behind this mod is to bring a bit of good ol' fashioned
British satire back to make light of it, as the TV show "The Thick Of It" did back in 2005. This therefore adds several political themed blocks, items, mobs and
structures to vanilla minecraft.
